# Ensure.That
Ensure.That is a simple guard clause argument validation lib, that helps you with validation of your arguments.

It's developed for .NET 4.5.1 as well as .NET Standard 1.1 and .NET Standard 2.0 and available via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ensure.that/).

### Using contextual validation
This flavour was introduced in the `v7.0.0` release.

```csharp
Ensure.String.IsNotNullOrWhiteSpace(myString);
Ensure.String.IsNotNullOrWhiteSpace(myString, nameof(myArg));
Ensure.String.IsNotNullOrWhiteSpace(myString, nameof(myArg), opts => opts.WithMessage("Foo"));
```
### Using static simple methods
The `EnsureArg` flavour was added in the `v5.0.0` release.

```csharp
EnsureArg.IsNotNullOrWhiteSpace(myString);
EnsureArg.IsNotNullOrWhiteSpace(myString, nameof(myArg));
EnsureArg.IsNotNullOrWhiteSpace(myString, nameof(myArg), opts => opts.WithMessage("Foo"));
```

## Turn On/Off - default is On
Could be used with different profiles. Like `Debug` and `CI` is `On` while `Release` is `Off`.

```csharp
#if RELEASE
    Ensure.Off()
#endif
```

### Using extension methods (OBSOLETE)
Since `v7.0.0` the `Ensure.That` flavour below has been marked as **`Obsolete`** with a warning and will be removed in the next major version (`v8.0.0`).

This was the initial way of doing validation, but **this IS NOT my prefered way**. Why? Well because it will
create a new instance of `Param<T>` wrapping the value being passed, so that the context-aware extension
methods can target correct type. *Imagine doing this in a loop on a multitude of instances...*

```csharp
//PLEASE NOTE. This will be depricated in v8.0.0 in favour for EnsureArg.Is...()

Ensure.That(myString).IsNotNullOrWhiteSpace();
Ensure.That(myString, nameof(myArg)).IsNotNullOrWhiteSpace();
```

```csharp
//PLEASE NOTE. This will be depricated in v8.0.0 in favour for EnsureArg.Is...()

Ensure
    .That(myString, nameof(myString))
    .WithExtraMessageOf(p => "Some more details")
    .IsNotNullOrWhiteSpace();
```

```csharp
//PLEASE NOTE. This will be depricated in v8.0.0 in favour for EnsureArg.Is...()

Ensure
    .That(myString, nameof(myString))
    .WithException(param => new Exception())
    .IsNotNullOrEmpty();
```

## Samples
The Samples above just uses `string` validation, but there are more. E.g.:

* Strings
* Numerics
* Collections (arrays, lists, collections, dictionaries)
* Booleans
* Guids

# Get up and running with the source code #
The main solution is maintained using Visual Studio 2017.

Unit-tests are written using `xUnit` and there are no integration tests, hence you should just be able to: `Pull`-`Compile`&`Run the tests`:

```
dotnet test
```
